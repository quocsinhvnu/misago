Development
===========

To start, clone the repository and run ``./dev init`` command in your terminal. This will build necessary docker containers, install python dependencies and initialize the database. After command does its magic, you will be able to start development server using the ``docker-compose up`` command.

After development server starts, visit the ``http://localhost:8000/`` in your browser to see your Misago installation.

Admin Control Panel is available under the ``http://localhost:8000/admincp/`` address. To log in to it use ``Admin`` username and ``password`` password.
